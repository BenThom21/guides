## Colors
Colors in CSS are a data type that represents a color to the computer. 
There are many ways to give color calues, but the most common ways are:
* Color Names
* RGB Values
* Hexadecimal Values

Example:
```css
.red {
  color: red;
  rgb(255, 0, 0)
  #FF0000
}
```

All modern browsers support 140 different names of colors but using RGB or Hex codes allows you to get more specific with colors.
